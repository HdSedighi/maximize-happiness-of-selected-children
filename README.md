# Intuition
Given an array of happiness values for n children and a positive integer k, the goal is to maximize the sum of the happiness values of k selected children. The selection process involves choosing one child at a time and decreasing the happiness values of the remaining children by 1 each time.

The best strategy is to select the children with the highest happiness values first, as this will maximize the sum of the selected children's happiness. This is straightforward since we want to maximize the sum of happiness values, which can be achieved by choosing children with the highest happiness values first.

# Approach
1. Sorting: First, sort the happiness array in descending order. This step ensures that the highest happiness values are processed first.
2. Iterate through the sorted array: Use a loop to iterate through the sorted happiness array.
3. Select k children: In each iteration, select the child with the current highest happiness value. Decrease the remaining children's happiness values by 1, but make sure the happiness values do not fall below 0.
4. Update total happiness: Add the selected child's happiness to the total happiness sum.
5. Adjust the index and k: Increment the index to move to the next child and decrement k until it reaches zero.
6.Return the total happiness sum: Once all k children are selected, return the total happiness sum.
This approach uses a combination of sorting the happiness array and iterating through it to select k children with the highest happiness values, adjusting the happiness of the remaining children each time.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The main operations in the approach involve sorting the happiness array, which takes O(nlogn) time complexity, and the loop for selecting k children, which takes O(k√ón) time complexity (in the worst case, iterating k times and each iteration adjusting up to n happiness values). Thus, the total time complexity is dominated by O(nlogn).
- Space complexity: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of space for variables and an additional array for sorting the happiness values. Thus, the space complexity is O(n), primarily due to the storage of the happiness array.
